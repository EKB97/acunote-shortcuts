Acunote Javascript Keyboard Shortcuts Mini-Framework
====================================================

With this mini-framework it takes only a few lines of code to empower your web
site or application with keyboard shortcuts. The framework supports both 
single-key and combo-key shortcuts just like Gmail and other Google applications.

We extracted the code from our production appplcation - Acunote, agile 
project management system written in Ruby on Rails. 


Features

* Supports single and combo-key shortcuts.
* Shortcut key sequence length is unlimited.
* All keys except for those which require modifiers (ctrl, alt, shift, 
  command, etc.) are allowed as shortcuts.
  For example "foo" or "/" are valid shortcuts because you can type all 
  symbols by single keypress, but "Foo" or "?" won't work because you have 
  to press Shift to type their symbols.
* Works in Mozilla Firefox 1+, Internet Explorer 6+, Opera 8+, Safari, Konqueror.
* Does not depend on any javascript library.


INSTALLATION

1) Download the plugin

2) Update your application javascripts and stylesheets with:

    rake acunote_shortcuts:install

3) In your application layout add:

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'acunote-shortcuts' %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag 'acunote-shortcuts' %>

4) Add onload event handler for HTML BODY element:

    <body onload="<%=init_shortcuts%>">

5) Configure global shortcuts in the layout:

    <% @global_shortcuts = { :h => "alert('Help!');" } %>

6) Configure local page shortcuts in the page template:

    <% @page_shortcuts = { :t => "alert('Test');" } %>

7) Call render shortcuts somewhere in the layout (preferably in the <head>):

    <%= render_shortcuts %>

8) Enjoy!

    Run the application and press 'h' or 't' keys
